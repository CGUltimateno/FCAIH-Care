<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is our third-year final technical project, developed as part of our coursework. It is an e-commerce website where users can purchase medical drugs. The website features separate sections for users and administrators. Users can browse and select products, add products to their cart, proceed to checkout, and place orders. Administrators have the capabilities to add new products, delete users, remove product categories, and update order statuses to keep users informed.
